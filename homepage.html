          Welcome To The Regis Jesuit High School Japanese Cultural Research Club
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Japanese Cultural Research Club aims to study and research both classical and modern Japanese culture. As such, our club provides personal lessons on the language of Japan, as well as the history and artistic qualities of Japanese society. We strive to constructively build social and cultural awareness via encouraged research on the Japanese and Asian collective in general. The Japanese cultural research club is born of Asian-Americansâ€™ desire to share their culture and traditions through means of academic teaching while giving insight into our contrasting perspectives, relative to what ideas may be held in the United States.
